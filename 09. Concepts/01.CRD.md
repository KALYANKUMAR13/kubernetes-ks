CRD:

A CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) in Kubernetes lets you create your own API objects, extending Kubernetes beyond built-in resources.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
the above link is crd for argocd.

It allows you to define custom kinds (like MyApp or Database) with their own schema.
Once a CRD is installed, you can create and manage those custom resources just like native Kubernetes objects.

Example: ArgoCD,Istio release their CRD.

We, the administrators will create a resource like deployments, svc for those related objects, these objects are called Custom Resources (CR)


A Custom Resource (CR) is an instance of a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD).
It represents actual data/config created using the schema defined by the CRD.
