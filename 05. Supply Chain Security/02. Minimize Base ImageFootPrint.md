Base Image vs Parent Image, 


A Base Image is a minimal, foundational image that does not come from another image.

```
FROM scratch
COPY my-binary /my-binary
CMD ["/my-binary"]

```

A Parent Image is the image you specify in the FROM instruction of a Dockerfile.

Every image (except scratch) has a parent image.

Parent images inherit from other images and add modifications.

Example of a Parent Image
```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt update && apt install -y nginx
```
