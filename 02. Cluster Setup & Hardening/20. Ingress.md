An Ingress Controller is a component in a Kubernetes cluster that manages Ingress resources and routes external HTTP/S traffic to internal services. It acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer for handling requests to services inside the cluster.

INgress Controller is not installed in k8s cluter by default.
