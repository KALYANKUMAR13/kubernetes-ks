In Kubernetes, User Accounts and Service Accounts serve different purposes:

**User Accounts**
Represent human users who interact with the cluster.
Not managed directly by Kubernetes (no built-in kubectl create user command).
Typically managed externally using IAM (Identity & Access Management) systems like:
Cloud IAM (AWS IAM, GCP IAM, Azure AD)
LDAP or OAuth providers
Certificates (client certs)
Authentication is handled using tokens, client certificates, or external identity providers.
Permissions are managed using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) via Role and RoleBinding or ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding.
**Service Accounts**
Represent non-human entities like Pods, Deployments, or Jobs that need to access the Kubernetes API.
Managed inside Kubernetes (kubectl create serviceaccount my-service-account).
Automatically assigned to Pods (each Pod gets a default service account unless specified otherwise).
Authenticate using JWT tokens stored in /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/.
Can be linked to external IAM roles (e.g., AWS IAM roles for service accounts).
Permissions are managed using RBAC just like user accounts.

By default, every **Namespace** in k8s cluster will have a **default service account**

when ever, we are creating any resource in k8s cluster, the token of the service account is mounted to it automatically.

We can't edit the serviceAccount of the existing pod, we need to delete it and edit the yaml manifest.

Previously the token of the default service account dosen't have any expiry date . Later on from 1.22 k8s version, they have made changes to it.

When a pod is created, default service account creates a token with a defined lifetime throught the token request api by the **service-account admission controller
**

For v1.24 k8s, thers is no default token is generated for service accounts, we need to manually ran a command to generate token, 
By default that token will have 1 hr of exipration time, we need add arguments to make it long.

Instead of doing above one, we can create a secret for the service account, that is non-expiring token

k8s docs recommed to use token
