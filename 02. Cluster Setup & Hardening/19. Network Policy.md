all Pods in a Kubernetes cluster can communicate with each other, even if they are in **different namespaces**.

Under policy type, what ever we mention that is applicable to the pods, when we define only ingress, only ingress is set, no egress is set.

All network CNI, dosen't support network policy object.

Policy can be created in Flannel aswell, but the rule is not applied.


If we didn't mention the namespace, db pod will allow all pods in all namespace. But if we added namespace, it will allow particular namespace resources only.

If backup server is not as a pod, then, we can have ipBlock cidr block particular IP.

The below 2 policy type works in OR logic, so ingress can be eithier one of resources.

this is considered as seperate policy , so here there are 3  either api-pod or prod namespace or IP address.
