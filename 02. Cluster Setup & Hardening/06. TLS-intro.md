**Sysmmentric Encryption:**

Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Here, hacker can sniff the data and able to decrypt the data.


**Asymmetric Encryption** ðŸ”‘
Asymmetric encryption is a type of encryption that uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. It is mainly used for secure communication, authentication, and digital signatures.

How It Works
When you visit an HTTPS website, the browser and server perform an asymmetric key exchange as part of TLS (Transport Layer Security):

Server Sends Public Key:

The web server has an SSL/TLS certificate containing a public key.
This certificate is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) (e.g., Let's Encrypt, DigiCert).
The browser retrieves this public key when accessing the website (https://example.com).
Client Encrypts a Secret (Symmetric Key):

The browser generates a random session key (used for symmetric encryption).
This session key is encrypted with the serverâ€™s public key and sent to the server.
Server Decrypts Using Private Key:

The server decrypts the session key using its private key.
Now both client and server have the same session key.
Switch to Symmetric Encryption:

After key exchange, symmetric encryption (AES) is used for the rest of the session.
Asymmetric encryption is too slow for bulk data, so it is only used during the handshake.

CA signs the our ACM. we send the .csr file certificate signing request , ca validates it. Browser has ceriticates that are legitimate by digicer

THer CA companies, have their own public and private keys, pulic keys are given to all browsers as browser can validate, as these are ligitimate.

Client can also send CSR that they are are legitimate consumer with valid privatekey and symmetic key during request.



we can entrypt with either of keys(pubic and private) and decrypt with other key.
