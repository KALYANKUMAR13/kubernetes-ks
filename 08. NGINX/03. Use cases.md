**LoadBalancer:**

It make sure, the all the request has been handled, and distributes the incoming request to all the backend servers. Nginx has healthcheck for these backend servers and when the backend server is unavilible(fails). It dosen't forward the traffic to that particular load balancer.

**Reverse Proxy:**

While the LoadBalancer only distributes the traffic its health pods/containers/nodes. The Goal is distribution of the traffic BUt Reverse Proxy -> acts as a Middle Man between backend servers and the httP request. The Reverse Proxy does'nd do the loadBalancing.

It controlls the request comming to it, should only forward to particular server or application

**Caching:**
Stores the copy of the data to serve the same kind of request to the endusers, reduces the latency. These requests are not send to backend servers, while it may be serves from the caching.
