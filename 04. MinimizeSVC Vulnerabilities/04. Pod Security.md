PodSecurityPolicy serves as an admission controller within Kubernetes, enabling cluster administrators to effectively manage security-related aspects of the Pod specification. By creating PodSecurityPolicy resources and defining requirements for Pods, administrators can control which Pods are allowed to run based on security policies. If a Pod complies with the defined PSP requirements, it is admitted to the cluster; otherwise, it is rejected.
