single cluster for all of it

When application grows and team grows, it is tough to manage the each clusters,. This make complexity and operational overhead for each cluster.

Pros:
reduces hardware cost and operational overhead


Types:

1. Muti-team tenancy
2. Mutil-customer tenancy

Prioritizing the APi-requrst for each tanent

 <img width="1458" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a424bc02-f258-4920-be21-a41d745b6d56" />

Here, the code is for prioritizing namespace but we can do any kind in the above picture.

 Similar to this, there is pod priority, if pod have a high priority, it gets the high resources in the cluster.


 if this implemented, k8s can destory some resources in lower priority resources,.
