When we have pvc without storageClass, before crating, Admission controller will look for storageClass is the manifest, if nothing is there, Mutating admission controller will have defined default storage class, it will be applied to the pvc.



Mutating Admission Controllers: it can change the manifest,

Validating Admission Controllers: it can Validate the request (by checking the manifest)


Mutating and Validating Admission Controllers are Kubernetes components that intercept API requests before they are persisted in etcd. They allow you to enforce policies, modify incoming objects, and reject invalid configurations.

1. Mutating Admission Controllers
Used to modify requests before they are stored.

Commonly used for injecting sidecars (e.g., Istio), adding labels, or setting default values.

Implemented as MutatingAdmissionWebhook.

Runs before the validation phase.

Example Use Case: Injecting a Sidecar
A webhook can modify a Pod request to inject a sidecar container before it's created.

2. Validating Admission Controllers
Used to validate requests and reject those that violate policies.

Commonly used for security enforcement (e.g., blocking privileged containers) or compliance checks.

Implemented as ValidatingAdmissionWebhook.

Runs after the mutation phase.

Example Use Case: Enforcing Resource Limits
A webhook can validate that Pod requests define CPU and memory limits before allowing deployment.
